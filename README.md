8) When a winning condition is present you should display a winner, either X or 0

## What I delivered

I managed to deliver 6/9


## Things that went well

I managed to get the box to display a different option after each time it was clicked

I also managed to change the text in the top left hand corner to display who's turn it was.

I managed to get my reset button to work.

# Things I had issues with

It took me a long time to figure out how to make each boxes alternate between X and O.(See mistake.js file for initial attempt). As a result, I had less time to achieve the remaining deliverables.
